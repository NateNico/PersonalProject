						<p>"As to my origins, do not imagine, my friend, that they are humble, for I am of the House of Amhara 
							which is a respected tribe; from it come the heads of the Ethiopian people, the governors, 
							the military commanders, the judges and the advisers of the King of Ethiopia who appoint and dismiss,

									<a href="genocide.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/AmharaGenocide.jpg" alt="Amhara Land and Wealth" /></a>
									<p>The Amhara people have been subjected to escalating violence that many describe as systematic genocide. 
										Ethnic-based attacks have resulted in mass casualties, forced displacements, and widespread human rights 
										violations. Villages have been destroyed, and countless lives have been lost in targeted assaults. 
										This article explores the historical context of these conflicts, provides detailed accounts of recent 
										atrocities, and emphasizes the urgent need for national and international intervention to halt the ongoing 
										violence against the Amhara community.</p>

										of Amhara Land & Wealth</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="land-wealth.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/AmharaHistoricalMap.jpg" alt="Amhara Land and Wealth" /></a>
									<p>Over the past decades, the Amhara people have experienced a systematic erosion of their ancestral lands 
										and economic resources. Policies favoring other regions and ethnic groups have led to the redrawing of 
										boundaries and the confiscation of fertile territories traditionally inhabited by Amharas. This loss of 
										land has been accompanied by the destruction of livelihoods, cultural heritage sites, and economic 
										disenfranchisement. Through an in-depth analysis of land policies, eyewitness accounts, and economic data, 
										this article uncovers the strategies used to marginalize the Amhara population and the profound impact on 
										their community.</p>
